============ Installation Instructions ============
1. Create a database (for example, codexworld) at phpMyAdmin and import the "SQL/users.sql" file into this database.

2. Open the "config.php" file in a editor: 
===> Specify the database host (DB_HOST), username (DB_USERNAME), password (DB_PASSWORD), and name (DB_NAME) as per your MySQL database credentials.
===> Specify the LinkedIn Client ID (LIN_CLIENT_ID), LinkedIn Client Secret (LIN_CLIENT_SECRET), and Callback URL (LIN_REDIRECT_URL) as per your LinkedIn App credentials.

3. Open the index.php file in the browser and test the LinkedIn Login functionality.
